//! Source-tagged revocation bus for the Connected state.
//!
//! # Entry into Connected
//!
//! `State::Connected` can only be returned from the three promotion sites in
//! `mod.rs` that have positively confirmed Gateway is ready:
//!
//! * `do_wait_for_api_ready` — confirms the `connected` label via
//!   `components_indicate_connected()`
//! * `do_configure_api` — runs after the login flow and apply_api_config has
//!   actually driven the Configure → Settings dialog (UI is responsive)
//! * `do_reconnecting_session` — confirms authentication via active label
//!   inspection
//!
//! Timeouts, retry exhaustion, or "absence of errors" never promote.
//! There is no debug override — `State::from_name("Connected")` returns
//! `None`, so SETSTATE Connected is rejected by the command server.
//!
//! # Exit from Connected (this module)
//!
//! `RevocationTracker` debounces contradiction observations per source and
//! returns `Some(source)` when a source's contradiction has persisted past
//! its own debounce window. `do_connected` calls it on every tick:
//!
//!   JvmDied                 → immediate
//!   ReloginDialog           → immediate
//!   SessionConflict         → immediate
//!   ErrorDialog             → 500 ms
//!   WindowClassMorphed      → 500 ms  (not wired yet; see TODO on the variant)
//!   LoginFormVisible        → 1 s
//!   DisconnectedLabelStable → 2 s
//!   ConnectionStatusEvent   → 2 s
//!
//! Every matured revocation emits a structured log line
//! (`proof revoked source=<tag> next=<state>`) so operators grepping
//! post-incident can find every Connected exit and why it fired.
