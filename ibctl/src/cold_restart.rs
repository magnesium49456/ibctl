//! Sunday cold restart timer.
//!
//! IBKR requires a full shutdown and re-login once a week (Sundays).
//! Gateway does NOT have a built-in cold restart — this is an IBC feature
//! that ibctl must replicate.
//!
//! How IBC handles it:
//! 1. IBC's Java code runs a timer checking for Sunday + ColdRestartTime
//! 2. When timer fires, creates COLDRESTART marker file
//! 3. Shuts down the Gateway JVM
//! 4. ibcstart.sh's while loop detects exit, finds marker, clears autorestart
//! 5. Relaunches JVM without autorestart flag → forces full re-auth + 2FA
//!
//! How ibctl handles it:
//! 1. Rust background task ticks every 30s.
//! 2. Each tick calls the PURE [`compute_next_action`] function with a fresh
//!    wall-clock sample and a fresh on-disk [`MarkerState`] snapshot. The
//!    decision is one of [`NextAction::Sleep`], [`NextAction::Skip`], or
//!    [`NextAction::FireEligible`].
//! 3. The fire window is "at-or-past target time on target day, with
//!    marker dedup" — NOT a strict minute equality. This deliberate
//!    widening defends against NTP forward jumps that would otherwise
//!    skip the exact minute landing (e.g., 08:45 → 10:00 step → never
//!    sampled 09:00). The on-disk fired marker provides the single-fire
//!    invariant.
//! 4. When FireEligible, the wrapper logs PENDING, sleeps 30s, then RE-EVALUATES
//!    by calling `compute_next_action` again with a fresh sample. This closes
//!    the race where a real cold-restart-equivalent (2FA re-auth) landed
//!    inside the warning window.
//! 5. Writes marker file to settings dir (survives container restart if
//!    volume-mounted) BEFORE sending the channel signal. If the marker
//!    write FAILS, the Fire signal is NOT sent — the wider window would
//!    otherwise re-fire on the next tick. This trades availability (we
//!    log an error and retry) for safety (no 2FA spam loop on broken
//!    permissions).
//! 6. Sends signal to state machine which kills JVM and does full re-auth.
//!
//! ## Bug-class proof: captured-once-then-stale state is unrepresentable
//!
//! The historical Bug 1 + Bug 4 were both instances of the same class — a RAM
//! boolean derived from `jiff::Zoned::now()` AT CONSTRUCTION that gated a
//! per-tick decision and went stale when a calendar boundary advanced past
//! the captured frame. The bug class is now eliminated by structure:
//!
//! - The PURE function [`compute_next_action`] has no `&mut self`, no closure
//!   environment, no statics — its type signature forbids hidden state.
//! - The SOLE captured-state container [`SchedulerConfig`] documents that no
//!   field may be a DERIVED PREDICATE (bool or scalar interpreting `now()`).
//!   The only time-derived field is [`SchedulerConfig::boot_at`], which is an
//!   immutable FACT (a specific wall-clock instant) — facts about the past do
//!   not go stale. Their INTERPRETATION ("was it past target?") is recomputed
//!   per-tick via [`started_past_target_on_startup_day`].
//! - The CI-enforced regression test
//!   `bug1_bug4_two_consecutive_sundays_same_cfg_both_fire` holds ONE
//!   `SchedulerConfig` across two synthetic Sundays and proves both
//!   return `FireEligible` from the pure function.
//! - The async-loop-body regression test
//!   `bug1_bug4_async_two_virtual_sundays_both_fire_via_scheduler_loop`
//!   drives the ACTUAL [`scheduler_loop`] async closure body across two
//!   virtual Sundays with `tokio::time::advance` and an injected clock,
//!   asserting two `ColdRestartSignal::Fire` arrive on the channel using
//!   ONE process lifetime / ONE `SchedulerConfig`. This catches the
//!   Bug 1 / Bug 4 class even if it lives in the async closure body
//!   (e.g., a future `let mut fired_this_lifetime = false;` captured by
//!   the per-tick match arm).
//! - The property test `bug_class_invariant_compute_next_action_is_pure`
//!   calls compute_next_action thrice with identical inputs and asserts
//!   identical outputs — catching any cached/hidden state.
//!
//! Timezone: respects the TZ env var (jiff uses system timezone).
