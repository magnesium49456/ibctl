"""Monitor: alert once when ibctl enters WaitingForHitl2fa.

Sends a rich ntfy action notification with a one-shot callback URL
signed by IBCTL_NTFY_ACTION_SIGNING_KEY. Only fires on the ENTRY
transition (State X -> WaitingForHitl2fa) — not on every tick while
in HITL.

When the signing key is missing OR the notification channel is not
ntfy, we fall back to a plain (no-action-button) notification that
tells the operator to drive HITL_RESUME from the dashboard UI.

Retry behaviour (Item 2):
  If the ntfy push fails, the monitor retries up to
  IBCTL_TWOFA_NTFY_SEND_RETRIES times (default 1) on subsequent 15-second
  ticks, until either the send succeeds or retries are exhausted.
  State is tracked per-mode so live/paper operate independently.
