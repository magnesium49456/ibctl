//! Three-phase reconnection recovery coordinator (pure decision layer + marker I/O).
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! The state machine currently retries reconnection back-to-back forever
//! when Gateway can't reach IB — the user watched paper cycle
//! `WaitingForLogin → Authenticating → WaitingFor2fa → (fail) →
//! ReconnectingSession → …` for an entire day on 2026-07-10. This module
//! adds a phase-timer wrapper around that inner loop:
//!
//! ```text
//!  Aggressive ── time > aggressive_phase_max ──►  BackoffEvery15Min
//!      ▲                                                │
//!      │                                        time > backoff_phase_max
//!      │                                                ▼
//!      └── ResumeToken ── (user tapped ntfy link) ── GivenUp
//! ```
//!
//! - **Aggressive**: current back-to-back retry loop. Timer runs from the last
//!   Connected-with-dwell success (or state-machine startup if never Connected).
//! - **BackoffEvery15Min**: throttled retries once the aggressive timer trips
//!   `aggressive_phase_max_secs`. The Restarting → WaitingForLogin cycle sleeps
//!   until the next `backoff_interval_secs` boundary.
//! - **GivenUp**: the SM halts reconnection attempts entirely and emits a
//!   ntfy alert with a signed callback URL (HITL-2FA pattern). Only exit is
//!   the user tapping the URL, which mints a `ResumeToken` that transitions
//!   back to `Aggressive` with a fresh phase timer.
//!
//! # Design constraints
//!
//! Mirrors [`crate::cold_restart`]'s pure/impure split verbatim:
//!
//! - [`compute_next_action`] is the SOLE authority for phase transition
//!   decisions. Referentially transparent. No `&mut`, no clock reads, no
//!   IO, no logging. Callers pass a [`RecoverySnapshot`] built from the
//!   coordinator's fields plus external inputs (elapsed durations,
//!   fingerprint streak, cold-restart-pending, resume token).
//! - Elapsed time is `min(wall_elapsed, mono_elapsed)` — computed by the
//!   caller. Wall alone would trip on NTP jumps and VM restore-from-snapshot;
//!   monotonic alone loses meaning across container restarts. `min()` is
//!   conservative: never escalate faster than the slower of the two.
//! - Cold-restart precedence: a scheduled cold restart preempts every phase
//!   transition. The [`NextAction::DeferToColdRestart`] variant signals this
//!   to the wrapper. Cold restart preserves `phase_entered_at` unless the
//!   post-restart Connected dwell records success.
//! - Fingerprint tripwire: if the state machine loops through the SAME
//!   `(last_error, transition, connect_stage)` fingerprint N times in a row,
//!   skip time-based escalation entirely and go straight to
//!   [`NextAction::ForceHitlEarly`]. Same failure repeating for 40 minutes
//!   is a stronger signal than "clock says 40 minutes elapsed".
//!
//! # Bug-class proof
//!
//! Every input to [`compute_next_action`] is either pure config or a per-tick
//! snapshot value. No captured-once-then-stale booleans (Bug 4 class). No
//! `Instant` or `Zoned` captured on struct construction and reused later —
//! the wrapper freshly samples both clocks each tick and passes the deltas.
//!
//! The `bug_class_invariant_compute_next_action_is_pure` determinism test
//! calls the function three times with identical inputs and asserts identical
//! outputs; any future change that violates purity is caught mechanically.

//     in Aggressive; caller logs `reason` as a warn.
//   - `RefusedGivenUpAutoReset { reason }` — main file corrupt AND sidecar
//     `.last-known-phase.txt` says "given_up". Coordinator BLOCKS at the
//     resume gate until `IBCTL_RECOVERY_FORCE_RESET=1` (`force_reset=true`).

// # Sidecar file
//
// A `.ibctl-recovery-state.{mode}.last-known-phase.txt` file mirrors the
// current phase name (from [`RecoveryPhase::as_str`]) as a single line.
// Written atomically BEFORE the main marker on every GivenUp save, so a
// disk-full or crash mid-main-write cannot lose the "we were in GivenUp"
// information. Pre-cleaned BEFORE the main marker on every non-GivenUp
// save so a subsequent parse-clean main marker with a stale "given_up"
// sidecar can be treated as a durable interrupted-transition record,
// not as a wedge to work around.
//
// Load consults the sidecar in three places:
//   1. When the main marker is missing (NotFound).
//   2. When the main marker read/parse fails.
//   3. When the main marker parses cleanly but its phase != GivenUp.
// In all three, "sidecar says given_up" → RefusedGivenUpAutoReset.
// force_reset=true (from `IBCTL_RECOVERY_FORCE_RESET=1`) bypasses this.

// RecoveryCoordinator — async wrapper around compute_next_action + persistence.
//
// PR-C stage 3 (RED phase): all methods `unimplemented!("stage 3 GREEN")`.
// GREEN phase wires this into `StateMachine` (see spec: types.rs + mod.rs
// apply_transition hooks + main-loop tick).
//
// Design principles mirrored from `crate::cold_restart::scheduler_loop`:
//
//   * `compute()` is a thin builder around the pure `compute_next_action` —
//     it samples clocks + reads accessors, but delegates every decision to
//     the pure function above. No policy lives here.
//
//   * `apply()` is the SOLE mutation surface: any phase transition, marker
//     write, alert-dedupe timestamp, or resume-token consumption goes
//     through this method. The wrapper (mod.rs main loop) can never
//     bypass it to mutate coordinator state directly.
//
//   * NO captured `jiff::Zoned::now()` or `Instant::now()` snapshotted at
//     construction and reused later. The coordinator's stored timestamps
//     represent EVENTS ("we entered this phase at T") — facts about the
//     past, not derived predicates. The Bug-4-class regression test
//     `test_bug_class_no_captured_now` asserts this structurally by
//     driving virtual time forward and checking the reported elapsed
//     reflects the delta.

    //! # Test dependency inversion

    //! `compute` / `apply` / `record_success` all take `now_wall` +
    //! `now_mono` as arguments — the coordinator never samples the
    //! wall/mono clock itself. This lets tests drive virtual time
    //! forward without `tokio::time::pause()` for the pure-logic
    //! coordinator tests. The dwell-timer tests, which do exercise
    //! `tokio::time::sleep`, use `pause()` + `advance()`.

    //! The 19-item spec list covers boot/apply/record_success/dwell.

    //! env (test 4) and tests that OBSERVE the "no force_reset" path
    //! (test 3, test 23) both acquire [`ENV_LOCK`] to prevent parallel
    //! test-thread races. Tests that don't care about force_reset
    //! (missing marker, fresh dir) do not lock — their outcome is
